### DISCLAIMER: This is a duplicate! Our original repo where most of this work was completed , [ogRepo](https://github.com/NickSily/Project3-Course-Scheduler.git), was where the main functions of this program were created.
<sup>(The orignal repo includes test.csv files and a python webscraper created by @NickSily)

</sub> This program works with students to help them create the most optimal schedule

<sub> * for CSE major only *

## Students are able to choose 

```
- Total number of semesters they desire to take
- Max number of credits per semester
- A variety of courses supplied by the UF CSE department
```

</sub> Upon filling up your schedule the program will run a topological sort inb packing to further optimize the program ideally allowing the user to be able to take less credits in the last semester/ have room for more classes.
