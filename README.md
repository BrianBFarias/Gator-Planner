# Schedule-Chomper

</sub> This program works with students to help them create the most optimal schedule

<sub> * for CSE major only *

## Students are able to choose 

```
- Total number of semesters they desire to take
- Max number of credits per semester 
```

</sub> Upon filling up your schedule the program will run a topological sort to further optimize the program ideally allowing the user to be able to take less credits in the last semester/ have room for more classes.
